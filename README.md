# Welcome to Our NLP Meetbot Project

Welcome to the NLP Meetbot project repository. Here, you'll find all the code for our project. Follow these instructions to test our methods effectively.

## Setting Up the Project

This project utilizes Poetry for dependency management, allowing for an easy setup process. To install all dependencies, execute the following command in your terminal:

poetry install

## Installing FFmpeg

Download the FFmpeg application from this link: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html. FFmpeg enables Whisper to access and process audio files from the project. After downloading, move the ffmpeg.exe file to the directory where you wish to process your audio files.

## Running the Project

To run the project, simply execute the main script and provide the path to your .wav audio file:

python main.py path/to/your/audio.wav

We have provided a sample audio file of a typical discussion for testing purposes. However, due to Git's file size limitations, it is relatively small. Feel free to test the bot with longer discussions to explore its full capabilities.

Enjoy exploring our NLP Meetbot project, and don't hesitate to contribute or provide feedback!
